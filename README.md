Important Notice to Members of Majestic Woods South Association
Dear Members,

As of December 4, 2024, The board of Majestic Woods South Homeowner's Association refuses to cooperate with my inquiry requests for information. The board consists of President John (Andrew) Strom, Treasurer Tom Byrne and Secretary Nancy Byrne.

It has come to our attention that there are several concerns regarding the governance and management of the Majestic Woods South Association. As members, it is essential that you are fully informed of the ongoing issues that could affect your rights, the integrity of the Association, and the management of our shared community.

We are facing serious uncertainties and potential violations in a number of critical areas. Below is a summary of the key issues that need to be addressed:

1. Governance and Decision-Making
The current Board of Directors, consisting of President John (Andrew) Strom Jr., Treasurer Tom Byrne, and Secretary Nancy Byrne, has not held formal, transparent meetings in accordance with the governing documents of the Association. Requests for meetings and transparency regarding financial matters, property management, and community governance have been met with resistance or complete disregard.

2. Non-Compliance with Wisconsin Law (WI Statutes 181)
Under Wisconsin law, specifically WI Stat. 181, nonprofit corporations, such as our Association, are required to file annual reports, provide financial transparency, and hold regular meetings to ensure proper governance. The Board has refused to adhere to these legal requirements, including:

Failure to provide a members' directory upon request, as allowed under WI Stat. 181.1602 and 181.1620.
Failure to hold annual meetings and communicate with the membership as required.

3. Unclear Chain of Custody and Transfer of Property
There are serious questions surrounding the transfer of property and governance after the quit claim deed issued by the Declarant to Northview Bank. This deed occurred simultaneously with the Second Amendment, and the bank became the successor declarant. However, it remains unclear how this transfer was managed and what rights, responsibilities, and legal obligations were transferred to the bank or to any subsequent entities.

4. Restrictions and Enforcement of Non-Existent Rules
There have been instances where the President, John (Andrew) Strom Jr., attempted to enforce restrictions on property owners that do not exist within our governing documents or the law. When questioned, the Board has failed to provide clear, valid justification for these actions. These types of actions could lead to misrepresentation and fraud, especially if they result in harm to members' property rights or the community at large.

5. Potential Violations of Civil Rights
Concerns have been raised that certain actions by the Board and President may violate federal civil rights protections under 18 U.S.C. §§ 241 and 242, as well as 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1985. These statutes protect individuals from conspiracies or actions that infringe on their constitutional rights, such as denial of due process, freedom of speech, and property rights. While the legal system will ultimately determine if any violations have occurred, it is crucial that all members are aware of the potential ramifications.

6. Refusal to Communicate and Respond
The Board has refused to respond to multiple certified letters sent by concerned members, effectively blocking efforts to resolve issues. This lack of response and the refusal to communicate in a meaningful way are indicative of broader governance concerns. Such behavior could hinder the Association’s ability to function properly and may be in violation of both state and federal laws.

What Can You Do?
We strongly encourage all members to:

Stay Informed – Understand your rights as members of the Association and the legal protections available to you under state and federal law.
Review the Governing Documents – Familiarize yourself with the Association’s Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and any amendments that apply to our community.
Join the Discussion – If possible, join any meetings or informal discussions with other members who are concerned about these issues. Your voice and participation are critical.
Consult Legal Counsel – If you believe your rights are being violated, or if you are unsure of your position, seek advice from an attorney who specializes in community associations or civil rights.

Conclusion
While the current state of affairs is concerning, it is important to approach these issues with due diligence and proper legal guidance. Our community deserves transparency, accountability, and respect for the rights of all members. If the Board continues to refuse communication or mismanages the Association, members may need to consider further legal options to protect their rights.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to the undersigned or to consult with legal counsel.

Sincerely,

Scott Ellis
