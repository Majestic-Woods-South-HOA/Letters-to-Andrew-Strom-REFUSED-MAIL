Dear Fellow Members,

There are several concerns regarding the governance and management of the Majestic
Woods South Association. As members, it is essential that you are fully informed of the
ongoing issues that could affect your rights, the integrity of the Association, and the
management of our shared community.

We are facing serious uncertainties and potential violations in a number of
critical areas. Below is a summary of the key issues that need to be addressed:

Governance and Decision-Making

The current Board of Directors, consisting of President John (Andrew) Strom Jr.,
Treasurer Tom Byrne, and Secretary Nancy Byrne, has not held formal, transparent
meetings in accordance with the governing documents of the Association for more than a
decade. Requests for meetings and transparency regarding financial matters, property
management, and community governance have been met with resistance or complete
disregard.

Non-Compliance with Wisconsin Law (WI Statutes 181) Under Wisconsin law,
specifically WI Stat. 181, nonprofit corporations, such as our Association, are required to
file annual reports, provide financial transparency, and hold regular meetings to ensure
proper governance. The Board has refused to adhere to these legal requirements,
including: Failure to provide a members' directory upon request, as allowed under WI
Stat. 181.1602.

Unclear Chain of Title and Transfer of Property

There are serious questions surrounding the transfer of property and governance after the
quit claim deed issued by the Declarant to Northview Bank in 2009. This deed occurred
simultaneously with the Second Amendment, and the bank became the successor
declarant. However, it remains unclear how this transfer was managed and what rights,
responsibilities, and legal obligations were transferred to the bank or to any other
subsequent entities.

Condominium Association Administrative Dissolution in 2015

In March 2015, the Condominium Association was administratively dissolved. This
dissolution has created significant confusion among members, as there was no clear
transition of authority or responsibilities after the dissolution. Key issues resulting from
this dissolution include:
• Uncertainty about the chain of title: It is unclear who holds the legal authority
for property management, maintenance, and decision-making after the
dissolution of the Condominium Association.
• Governance gaps: The absence of a clear transition plan following the
dissolution has left the community uncertain about who is responsible for
overseeing the day-to-day operations of the association and addressing any
future legal or property concerns.
• Impact on property rights: Members are left without clear guidance on how
the dissolution affects their individual property rights and obligations within the
Association.
These unresolved issues stemming from the dissolution in 2015 require immediate
attention and clarity from the Board.

Malfeasance of Rogue Unelected President- Enforcement of
Non-Existent Rules

There have been instances where the President, John (Andrew) Strom Jr., attempted to
enforce restrictions on property owners that do not exist within our governing
documents or the law. When questioned, the Board has failed to provide clear, valid
justification for these actions. These types of actions could lead to misrepresentation and
fraud, especially if they result in harm to members' property rights or the community
at large.

Potential Violations of Civil Rights

Concerns have been raised that certain actions by the Board and President may violate
federal civil rights protections under 18 U.S.C. §§ 241 and 242, as well as
42 U.S.C. §§ 1985. These statutes protect individuals from conspiracies or actions that
infringe on their constitutional rights, such as denial of due process, freedom of speech,
and property rights. While the legal system will ultimately determine if any violations
have occurred, it is crucial that all members are aware of the potential ramifications.
Refusal to Communicate and Respond
The Board has refused to respond to multiple certified letters sent by concerned
members, effectively blocking efforts to resolve issues. This lack of response and the
refusal to communicate in a meaningful way are indicative of broader governance
concerns. Such behavior could hinder the Association’s ability to function properly and
may be in violation of both state and federal laws.

What Can You Do?:

Stay Informed – Understand your rights as members of the Association and the legal
protections available to you under state and federal law. Review the Governing
Documents – Familiarize yourself with the Association’s Articles of Incorporation,
Bylaws, and any amendments that apply to our community. Join the Discussion – Your
voice and participation are critical. Be heard!

Conclusion

While the current state of affairs is quite concerning, it is important to approach these
issues with due diligence and proper legal guidance. Our community deserves
transparency, accountability, and respect for the rights of all members.
The solution is to hold a special meeting and Vote. Our recent assessments reflect the
corporations ill regard for anyone. They self appoint. My voice certainly doesn’t matter,
the question I have for fellow members, does yours?
Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to the
undersigned. I’ve attached a chronological time line of the Associations past actions.

Sincerely,

Scott Ellis
